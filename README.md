# NYC Taxi Data Processing with Python

## üìå Introduction

This project leverages **big data technologies in the cloud** to analyze large-scale trip data from the **New York City (NYC) Yellow Taxi service**. Using **Hadoop MapReduce**, **PySpark** and Python, we process millions of taxi trip records to uncover operational and business insights. The analysis focuses on three main objectives:

1. **Total revenue generated by each vendor** ‚Äì to compare the financial performance of taxi service providers.
2. **Frequency of each payment type** ‚Äì to understand customer payment preferences and trends.
3. **Total distance travelled by each vendor** ‚Äì as a proxy for operational scale and geographic coverage.
